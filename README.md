## User stories & Acceptance Criteria
This project is designed to give users an overview of popular films, tv shows and actors.
### Core Stories
* See an interesting mashup of different data
* Input information to change the displayed result
* View the app on all of my devices
### Stretch Stories
* As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading
* As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong
### Acceptance Criteria
* [x] Query at least two APIs using fetch
* [x] Dynamic content generated with JS
* [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
* [x] A responsive, mobile-first design
* [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
## APIs Used
For this project we made use of [The Movie Database API (TMDB)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) and [Image-Charts](https://documentation.image-charts.com/). We use TMDB to find out whats popular at the moment and Image-Charts to make graphs with some of the data available to us. 
## Installation
You will need to create an account with [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) to get your own API keys

Clone this repo using

## Learning outcomes
### JavaScript
* Write code that executes asynchronously
* Use callbacks to access values that aren’t available synchronously
* Use promises to access values that aren’t available synchronously
* Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses
* Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests
* Use the map array method to create a new array containing new values
* Use the filter array method to create a new array with certain values removed
### DOM
* Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors
* Add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page
* Toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties
### Design
* Use consistent layout and spacing
* Follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel
### Developer Toolkit
* Debug client side JS in our web browser
* Use console.log() to help us debug our code
